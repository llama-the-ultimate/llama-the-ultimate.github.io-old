And so I replaced the PureScript code and the Monaco editor used for <a href="../lists/lambs.html">the lambda things</a> with some JavaScript and CodeMirror.
Something to do with liking smol things, hundreds being smoller than thousands, and so on.</p><p>Anyway there once was like <a href="http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/jonas-winje">a Lambda Days talk</a> about the PureScript-and-Monaco version of the stuff.
So things like <a href="http://llama-the-ultimate.org/slides/lambdadays2018/">these slides</a> are in some sense vaguely out of date.</p><p>Like, that is, links to code and such should work. Links in the direction of lambda editors that run in the browser now lead to JavaScript-and-CodeMirror version.
Which mostly doesn’t like matter, since they work pretty much the same.
The latest PureScript-and-Monaco version of the stuff is tagged as
<a href="https://github.com/llama-the-ultimate/llama-the-ultimate.github.io/tree/monaco-and-ps">monaco-and-ps</a>.
It can be checked out or downloaded and should like run just fine from local filesystem.</p><p>(The code currently in use is mostly the stuff in this <a href="https://glitch.com/~lambs">Glitch project</a>.
Is JavaScript so I don’t know what I’m doing etc.
But like Glitch is nice.)</p></div></body></html>
