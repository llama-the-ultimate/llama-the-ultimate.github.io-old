Some stuff from an earlier <a href="lamb-nums.html">numbery post</a>:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem" prelude="true">0 ≜ λf.λx.x
1 ≜ λf.λx.f x
2 ≜ λf.λx.f (f x)
5 ≜ λf.λx.f (f (f (f (f x))))
+ ≜ λa.λb.λf.λx.a f (b f x)</div><p>(And in the earlier post we said something like:
The number <em>n</em> is a function that,
if given two arguments,
applies the first argument <em>n</em> times to the second.
The <span class="codew">+</span>-function takes the numbers <span class="codew">a</span> and <span class="codew">b</span> as arguments
and gives back a new <span class="code">λf.λx.</span>-function that applies <span class="codew">f</span> “<span class="codew">a</span> times”
to the result of applying <span class="codew">f</span> “<span class="codew">b</span> times” to <span class="codew">x</span>.)</p><p>We can do like multiuplication as well, before moving on.
Multiplication is like addition, just more.
We will make a function that, if given the numbers <span class="codew">a</span> and <span class="codew">b</span> as arguments,
will like, start with the number zero, and add <span class="codew">a</span> “<span class="codew">b</span> times” to it:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">* ≜ λa.λb.b (+ a) 0

* 5 2</div><hr/><p>Soo. We have several numbers and also a couple of ways to make more numbers.
So we pretty much have business:
We can decide that one of the numbers is the number of monies and another one is the number of products.
If we also have booleans we can do business logic.</p><p>Booleans are used for if-then-else.
We have a stuff we maybe wanna do and another stuff we maybe wanna do instead, and we use a boolean to pick one of the stuffs.
So, we would like to have a <span class="codew">true</span>-value and a <span class="codew">false</span>-value,
and we wanna set things up so that something like <span class="code">if true stuff otherstuff</span> will evaluate to <span class="codew">stuff</span>,
and something like <span class="code">if false stuff otherstuff</span> will evalute to <span class="codew">otherstuff</span>.</p><p>We will make the two boolean values be functions. (A reasonably easy choice, so long as we can only make functions in our language.)
<span class="codew">true</span> will, if given two arguments, return the first one. <span class="codew">false</span>, if given two arguments, will return the second one.</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">true ≜ λa.λb.a
false ≜ λa.λb.b

true stuff otherstuff

false stuff otherstuff</div><p>Okay so it looks like <span class="code">true stuff otherstuff</span> evaluates to <span class="codew">stuff</span> just fine on it’s own,
and <span class="code">false stuff otherstuff</span> evaluates to <span class="codew">otherstuff</span>,
and we don’t really need <span class="codew">if</span>.
But like if we want an <span class="codew">if</span> we can have one.
It can take a boolean as its first arguments and then two more arguments,
and then like, just, hand those two last arguments over to the boolean.</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">if ≜ λb.λt.λe.b t e

if true stuff otherstuff

if false stuff otherstuff</div><p>Should get same results as with just the booleans.
(And if we want to, we can redefine <span class="codew">if</span> to be the identity function, <span class="code">λx.x</span>.
Will work fine.
The <span class="code">if true</span> part of <span class="code">if true stuff otherstuff</span> wil evaluate to <span class="codew">true</span>.
So we get <span class="code">true stuff otherstuff</span>, which we already know that works.)</p><hr/><p>Okay, some boolean logic bits:</p><ul><li><span class="codew">not</span> takes one boolean <span class="codew">b</span>. If <span class="codew">b</span> is <span class="codew">true</span>, <span class="codew">not</span> returns <span class="codew">false</span>. If <span class="codew">b</span> is <span class="codew">false</span>, <span class="codew">not</span> returns <span class="codew">true</span>.</li><li><span class="codew">and</span> takes two booleans <span class="codew">a</span> and <span class="codew">b</span>. If <span class="codew">a</span> is <span class="codew">true</span>, <span class="codew">and</span> returns <span class="codew">b</span>. If <span class="codew">a</span> is <span class="codew">false</span>, <span class="codew">and</span> returns <span class="codew">false</span>.</li><li><span class="codew">or</span> takes two booleans <span class="codew">a</span> and <span class="codew">b</span>. If <span class="codew">a</span> is <span class="codew">true</span>, <span class="codew">or</span> returns <span class="codew">true</span>. If <span class="codew">a</span> is <span class="codew">false</span>, <span class="codew">or</span> returns <span class="codew">b</span>.</li></ul><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">not ≜ λb.if b false true
and ≜ λa.λb.if a b false
or ≜ λa.λb.if a true b

if (and (or true false) (not false)) stuff otherstuff</div><hr/><p>We’ll do some boolean stuff with numbers.
We can check if a number is zero by giving it two arguments.
The first argument is a function that always returns <span class="codew">false</span>: <span class="code">λ_.false</span>.
If the number is not zero this function will be applied to something and we’ll get <span class="codew">false</span> back.
The second argument is <span class="codew">true</span>.
If the number is zero this <span class="codew">true</span> will be returned, without any applying of the <span class="code">λ_.false</span>-function.</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">zero? ≜ λn.n (λ_.false) true

zero? 0

zero? 2</div><p>Good. Now we can do everyday business logic things.
Like you know when boss is like hey we need a program that checks if the number of monies times the number of products is zero
and if it is zero we should add five to the number of monies and if it is not zero we should multiply the number of products by 2.
And like, <em>no problem</em>.</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:20rem">do-business ≜ λmonies.λproducts.if (zero? (* monies products)) (+ 2 monies) (* 2 products)

do-business 2 5

do-business 2 0</div><p>That’s a lot of business.</p><hr/><p>(Oh. If we cared about side effects or maybe performance or something,
we would maybe worry about stuff like: Will the else-stuff be evaluated even if the boolean is <span class="codew">true</span> and we really only want the then-stuff?
We don’t really care, since it’s going to correctly return the stuff we want either way.
But like, <em>if</em> we cared:
We’re evaluating things in normal order, and will give the then-stuff and the else-stuff to the boolean first, before we “step into” any of the then-stuff or else-stuff.
So like in the case of <span class="codew">true</span> the else-stuff will disappear before we do anything with it.)</p></div></div><script data-main="../lambstuff/reqmain" src="../lambstuff/require.js"></script><script src="../lambstuff/monaco-editor/min/vs/loader.js"></script><script src="../lambstuff/stuff.js"></script></body></html>
