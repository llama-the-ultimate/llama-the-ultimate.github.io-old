S ≜ λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)</div><p>Now there are some things. Or, this possibly encourages a way of thinking about some things.</p><p>One thing is: We can think that any natural number must necessarily be built from <span class="codew">0</span> and a series of <span class="codew">S</span>es.
(And if we’d like, we can think about the types of things, and argue that <span class="code">0 : nat</span> and <span class="code">S : nat -&gt; nat</span>.)</p><p>Another thing is: A number like this is a function. And that function kind of is the “eliminator function” for that number.
An “eliminator function” like this is rather similar to the <a href="foldr.html">foldr</a>-function for lists;
we can think of it as a function for doing “constructor replacement.”</p><p>Like if we have a number built from <span class="code">S (S 0)</span>, and we wanna replace the <span class="codew">S</span>es with <span class="codew">foo</span>s and the <span class="codew">0</span> with <span class="codew">bar</span>,
we can apply the number to <span class="codew">foo</span> and <span class="codew">bar</span>:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:9rem">(S (S 0)) foo bar</div><hr/><p>So, say we have the numbers <span class="codew">2</span> and <span class="codew">3</span>...</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">S (S 0)

S (S (S 0))</div><p>Reduced to normal form:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:5rem">2 ≜ λf.λx.f (f x)

3 ≜ λf.λx.f (f (f x))</div><p>And, say we want to add them together.
If we want the sum, we can take the number <span class="codew">2</span> and do the “constructor replacement” thing.
The number <span class="codew">2</span> is built from the <span class="codew">0</span>-constructor and 2 <span class="codew">S</span>-contructors: <span class="code">S (S 0)</span>.
We should be able to get sum by taking that number and, keeping all the <span class="codew">S</span>es, replacing the <span class="codew">0</span> with <span class="codew">3</span>:
<span class="code">S (S 3)</span>, which should amount to like 5.</p><p>We try. Taking the number <span class="codew">2</span>, we replace <span class="codew">S</span> with <span class="codew">S</span>, which should let us “keep” all the <span class="codew">S</span>es,
and we replace <span class="codew">0</span> with <span class="codew">3</span>:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">2 S 3</div><p>We get 5 :)</p><p>A bit of abstraction and we will have a <span class="codew">+</span>-function.</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">+ ≜ λa.λb.a S b

+ 2 3</div><hr/><p>Or, say we want to multiply <span class="codew">2</span> by <span class="codew">3</span>.</p><p>This time the idea is that we want to replace things so that we turn the number <span class="codew">2</span>, or <span class="code">S (S 0)</span>,
into <span class="code">+ 3 (+ 3 0)</span>.
We replace the <span class="codew">S</span>es with a function that adds 3 to something, and we replace <span class="codew">0</span> with <span class="codew">0</span>:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">2 (+ 3) 0</div><p>6!</p><p>Again, abstraction:</p><div class="editor" name="lambs" style="height:10rem">* ≜ λa.λb.a (+ b) 0

* 2 3</div><hr/><p>(So, uh. In my experience, thinking about these things in terms of constructors and constructor replacement
lets me look away from the “inner workings” of the numbers a little bit,
and also make the things feel slightly more like working with datatypes in e.g. an ML dialect.
It sometimes makes some things clearer to me.
But like, we totally did do <a href="lamb-nums.html">addition</a> and <a href="lamb-bools.html">multiplication</a> earlier,
and it’s not like the functions we did here are very different from those earlier ones. Just a little different.)</p></div></body><script data-main="../lambstuff/reqmain" src="../lambstuff/require.js"></script><script src="../lambstuff/monaco-editor/min/vs/loader.js"></script><script src="../lambstuff/stuff.js"></script></html>
