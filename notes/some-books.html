Maybe a quote or two, maybe a note about <em>something</em>,
but mostly just like, these are some books.
I don’t think I disliked reading them.</p><p>(The dates under the titles are just when that bit was added to this page.
Like they don’t have much to do with when the books were written or read or anything.)</p><h2 id="seeing-like-a-state"><a href="#seeing-like-a-state" class="selflink">Seeing Like a State</a></h2><div class="date">(2018-06-14)</div><blockquote><p>The detailed reasons for the failure are of less interest for our purposes
than the fact that most of them could be summarized under the rubric of <em>context</em>.</p></blockquote><p>James C. Scott. I read this book because <a href="https://twitter.com/marick">Brian Marick</a> sometimes recommends this book?</p><p>A “big rewrite” of like a city or a forest is also bad.

And then I stopped reading it before I had read very much of it.
This one I read all of, which maybe suggests that I like this one more better.</p><h2 id="against-method"><a href="#against-method" class="selflink">Against Method</a></h2><div class="date">(2018-06-14)</div><blockquote><p>theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its law-and-order alternatives</p></blockquote><p>Paul Feyerabend.

Oh and like, not from or even directly about the book,
but I like these bits from <a href="http://2010philipkdickfans.philipkdickfans.com/frank/vertexin.htm">an interview</a>:</p><blockquote><p>All the parts of that book did not add up; all the ingredients did not make a coherency.

And how happy are you with order?</p></blockquote><h2 id="dispossessed"><a href="#dispossessed" class="selflink">The Dispossessed</a></h2><div class="date">(2018-06-14)</div><blockquote><p>In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty;
in the rites of the moneychangers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men’s acts,
even the terrible became banal.</p></blockquote><p>Ursula K.
