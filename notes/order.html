Code here.
We could have used like some Standard ML code and some Haskell code or something instead.
Just, handy to use “the same” code for both versions and only switch between the two <span class="codew">#lang</span>s.
And then also we are not writing Racket code exactly the way we normally would, but like,
sticking to reasonably basic stuff andalso stuff that works
in both <span class="code">#lang racket</span> and <span class="code">#lang lazy</span>.)</p></div></body></html>
