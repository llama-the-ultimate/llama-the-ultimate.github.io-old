 If you have like an A -> B, then you can usually count on getting a B back if
 you pass in an A. In this or that language, there may be exceptions to this.
 For example, an exception would be an exception.

       @p{
 Okay @q{exception} and @q{exceptional} are two words. Something something
 substring, but theyâ€™re probably not actually the same word. Anyway I think the
 @q{exceptions should be exceptional} thing sometimes comes off as being a
 little too concerned with rarity.
